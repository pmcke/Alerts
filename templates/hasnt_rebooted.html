There may not be anything wrong. It may only be confused.

1) Log into your pi/computer. Look in the RMS_Data folder. Look for a file called ".reboot_lock". You may need 
  to go to View/Show Hidden in the menu to see this file. Files that begin with a dot are hidden files. 
  If you are using the command line, use "ls -la to see hidden files. If you see this file delete it.

2) Reboot the pi/computer. Try to do this gracefully at the command line (sudo reboot) but power cycle it if 
  you must. Everything will probably be OK after a reboot but if this error reoccurs, ask us for help.
