This indicates the camera is not connected to the pi/computer. 

Things to check

1/ Is the power switched on to the POE injector, which powers the camera.

2/ Are all the connections intact. Detach and replug all the ethernet connectors.

3/ Check the ethernet cables are plugged in the right places. On the POE injector 
  the two ports are labelled POE & LAN. The cable to the camera goes into POE and 
  the cable to the raspberry pi goes into LAN. 

4/ Check the lights. There should be one light on the POE injector. It should be solid on. 
  If it is flashing then the POE injector is in an error state.

5/ Check the lights on the POE splitter. One blue light indicates power is on. A green 
  light occasionally blinking indicates network traffic.

6/ Is the POE splitter warm to the touch. This may indicate a failed POE splitter. 
  These don't fare well when exposed to the weather. Ask for a replacement if it appears 
  to have failed.

7/ Inside the camera housing, check that all the plugs are well seated on the camera board. 
  There is one small plug for power, one larger one for data. A third plug that is loose is OK.

If you are unsure, please reach out to Peter (gmn@mckellar.net.nz) or Steve (steve@matheson.net.nz) if you need help
